# Forest Residuals-to-Jet Fuel Supply Chain Documentation

## Overview: 
Supply chain resilience assessment includes two parts: integrated risk assessment to capture the combined effects of multiple risk factors on supply chain performance, and resilience assessment to calculate the long-term supply chain resilience in planning horizon. The purpose of this documentation is to illustrate how to run the Forest Residuals-to-Jet Fuel supply chain resilience assessment based on FTOT optimization and several outputs from risk assessment.
